I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) and [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Dahua Lin](https://dahua.site/) and [Jiangmiao Pang](https://oceanpang.github.io/). I obtained my M.Phil. degree at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html) and B.Eng. degree at [ShanghaiTech](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/). 

I have spent a wonderful time in [Tencent Robotics X](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/zh/index) and [Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute](https://sqz.ac.cn/). 

My previous research focus on robot learning from demonstrations. My current research focuses on humanoid robot learning. Outside of academics, I am an enthusiast of [street/human photography](gallery).
