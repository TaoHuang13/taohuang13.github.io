I have spent a wonderful time in [Tencent Robotics X](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/zh/index) and [Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute](https://sqz.ac.cn/). 

My previous research focus on robot learning from demonstrations. My current research focuses on humanoid robot learning. Outside of academics, I am an enthusiast of [street/human photography](gallery).
